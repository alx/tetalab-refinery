Ces caméras sont uniquement renvoyées en temps réel au Poste Centrale de Commandement qui peut, grâce à ces caméras, vérifier à distance le bon fonctionnement des équipements tels que les escaliers mécaniques, ascenseurs, valideurs, distributeurs automatiques….</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conformément au règlement j’aimerai avoir accès à la video me concernant, qui a été prise par la caméra situé juste au dessus du guichet à  tickets. » La communication des images n’est pas possible comme évoqué précédemment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De plus, j’ai quelques questions à vous poser, si vous avez le temps d’y répondre :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>combien de temps les vidéos sont-elles conservées?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Les systèmes présents dans les stations de métro enregistrent 10 jours, durée qui a fait l’objet d’une autorisation préfectorale,</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>comment peut-on vérifier la destruction de ces vidéos? Un rendez-vous peut être organisé en nos locaux pour vérifier la destruction mais pas pour procéder à une consultation.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>vous demande-t-on souvent l’accès ou la vérification de la destruction de vidéos?

It is defined in GSM 11.11 or ETS 300 977 in the <a href=\"http://www.etsi.org\">ETSI</a> denomination. As a smartcard, the way to communicate with it goes thru <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APDU\">ADPU</a>. You can either use a card reader or ( less in fact ) directly use a gsm modem to issue commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard command set for GSM modem is defined in &#160; “AT Command set for GSM Mobile Equipment (ME) “ (TS 07.07) or just ETS 100 916. It defines a lot of command to interecact with the network or the simcard. As I just want explore the filesystem of my SIM, we’ll just use a command to issue raw adpu directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>8.17 Generic SIM access +CSIM\r\n\r\nCommand&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Possible response(s)\r\n+CSIM=&lt;length&gt;,&lt;command&gt; +CSIM: &lt;length&gt;,&lt;response&gt;\r\n                         +CME ERROR: &lt;err&gt;\r\n+CSIM=?\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nSet command transmits to the ME the &lt;command&gt; it then shall send as it is to the SIM. In the same manner the SIM\r\n&lt;response&gt; shall be sent back by the ME to the TA as it is. Refer subclause 9.2 for &lt;err&gt; values.\r\nThis command allows a direct control of the SIM by an distant application on the TE. The TE shall then take care of\r\nprocessing SIM information within the frame specified by GSM.\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Using +CSIM command, you can directly issue the ADPU defined in GSM 11.11. It basically contains the following subset.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>SELECT             'A4'      '00'         '00'   '02' S/R\r\nSTATUS             'F2'      '00'         '00'   lgth  R\r\nREAD BINARY        'B0'  offset high  offset low lgth  R\r\nUPDATE BINARY     'D6'   offset high  offset low lgth  S\r\nREAD RECORD        'B2'   rec No.       mode     lgth  R\r\nUPDATE RECORD     'DC'    rec No.       mode     lgth  S\r\nSEEK               'A2'      '00'    type/mode   lgth S/R\r\nINCREASE           '32'      '00'         '00'   '03' S/R\r\nVERIFY CHV         '20'      '00'     CHV No.    '08'  S\r\nCHANGE CHV         '24'      '00'     CHV No.    '10'  S\r\nDISABLE CHV        '26'      '00'         '01'   '08'  S\r\nENABLE CHV         '28'      '00'         '01'   '08'  S\r\nUNBLOCK CHV       '2C'       '00'     see note   '10'  S\r\nINVALIDATE         '04'      '00'         '00'   '00'  -\r\nREHABILITATE       '44'      '00'         '00'   '00'  -\r\nRUN GSM ALGORITHM  '88'      '00'         '00'   '10' S/R\r\nSLEEP             'FA'       '00'         '00'   '00'  -\r\nGET RESPONSE      'C0'       '00'         '00'   lgth  R\r\nTERMINAL PROFILE    '10'     '00'         '00'   lgth  S\r\nENVELOPE          '#C2'       '00'         '00'   lgth S/R\r\nFETCH              '12'      '00'         '00'   lgth  R\r\nTERMINAL RESPONSE  '14'      '00'         '00'   lgth  S\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>As we’ll just  have a look in the filesystem of the SIM, we’ll just focus on the SELECT, READ BINARY, READ RECORD and GET RESPONSE command. Just to summarize the other are either dedicated to write to the sim (UPDATE family),related to  the card holder (CHV family), we’ll discuss on the RUN GSM ALGORITHM and the Sim Application Toolkit command (ENVELOPE, FETCH, TERMINAL PROFILE…) later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an overview of the filesystem that is implemented in all SIM card</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/images/pg/simfs-270x300.gif\" alt=\"simfs\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, all file belong to the Master File (you can think about / on unix) there are mainly 2 subsets : DF (dedicated file ) a kind of directory which contains EF (elementary file) where datas are stored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 3 kinds of EF :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Transparent EF : binary file, you mainly access its contain by specify its relative address (offset) the total length is specified in the header. The first byte of a transparent EF has the relative address ‘00 00’.</li>\r\n  <li>Linear fixed EF :&#160; consists of a sequence of records all having the same (fixed) length. It is not possible to have more than 255 records in a file of this type, and each record cannot be greater than 255 bytes. The first record is record number 1.</li>\r\n  <li>Cyclic EF&#160; : Cyclic files are used for storing records in chronological order. When all records have been used for storage, then the next storage of data shall overwrite the oldest information. An EF with a cyclic structure consists of a fixed number of records with the same (fixed) length.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a word on Access Right, as i play with deactivated simcard issued by an operator, i can only grant myself to CHV1 or CHV2 level not ADM (no root dance this night :p). This mean that some file may not be updated. For example EFIMSI (which hold the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Subscriber_Identity\">IMSI</a> number) has the following access condition :</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>10.3.2      EFIMSI (IMSI)\r\n\r\nThis EF contains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).\r\n\r\nIdentifier: '6F07'            Structure: transparent             Mandatory\r\n    File size: 9 bytes                        Update activity: low\r\nAccess Conditions:\r\nREAD                        CHV1\r\nUPDATE                      ADM\r\nINVALIDATE                  ADM\r\nREHABILITATE                CHV1\r\nBytes                        Description                 M/O          Length\r\n1          length of IMSI                                M           1 byte\r\n2-9           IMSI                                       M           8 bytes\r\n</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>so when you’re granted to CHV1 (ie you entered your PIN code) you can read its value but neither change it nor deactivate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact you can simply get its value by issueing the AT+CIMI command, here is the process to access it with adpu .</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Select the Master File (3F00)</li>\r\n  <li>Select DF_GSM (7F20)</li>\r\n  <li>Select EF_IMSI (6F07)</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Read&#160;

More than the political considerations of free the more than widely spreaded GSM technology, it’s just an amazing playground of protocols and devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the networking parts, there’s also an effort on opening the handset, as demonstrated by <a href=\"http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Openmoko</a> and Android platform. I’ll sometimes play with these “toys” that are most visible part of the “opensource mobile movment”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS: I’m not an engineer of these topics, just another geek hobbyist, so I may omit things or do some mistakes.
